# 🖼️ Inky Weather Dashboard  
### Family Weather Dashboard for Raspberry Pi Zero W + Inky Impression 7.3"

This project creates a high-contrast, 7-day weather dashboard displayed on a **Pimoroni Inky Impression 7.3" e-paper display**, powered by a **Raspberry Pi Zero W**.

It fetches live weather data, renders a full HTML dashboard, screenshots it at high resolution, converts it to the Inky colour palette, and displays it automatically on a schedule.

Although the code for this project was written by myself as a learning exercise, the heavy inspiration for this (I basically copied the look of and the png's for some of the icons) comes from https://github.com/fatihak/InkyPi

## 🌤️ How It Works

1. `fetch_weather.py` fetches updated weather via OpenWeather API.  
2. A temporary HTTP server serves the `web/` folder.  
3. `wkhtmltoimage` renders the dashboard at 800 x 480
4. `show_screenshot.py` applies palette, and displays the image.  
5. A cron job runs this process every 3 hours.
